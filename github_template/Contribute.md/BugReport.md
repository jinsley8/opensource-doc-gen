First of all, if you find a security vulnerability or suspect a problem to be security-related, 
please do NOT open an issue and do NOT discuss it in anywhere public. 
Email dev-support@quantstamp.com instead.

please follow the steps that will certainly help us and will also help you solve the bug faster:
1. Search if your bug has been reported or not. 
2. Check if you are using the latest version.
3. Make sure what you're describing is really a bug.


Once you're certain that you should submit the bug, 
we highly recommend filing an issue through github to get a timely response. 

To submit an issue, please include the following information in your post:
1. What is the version that you are using?
2. What OS are you using? Please include its version as well for reference.
3. What is your goal when performing the actions?
4. What did you do?
5. What did you expect to see?
